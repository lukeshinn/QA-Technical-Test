# QA-Technical-Test
Selenium and API testing examples

### Dependencies
This project was built on a MacOS environment. I have not tested on a windows/linux OS yet.
Here's what you need to have on your machine to run the selenium tests in the [part_a](part_a) directory

python 2.7.10 >

html-testRunner

selenium

chromedriver

webdriver-manager

faker

# Installation
The [Python package installer](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) is the recommended method for installing dependencies. If you don't have pip currently you can run the following command to install this package manager

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

after you have the pip package manager, if you are missing any of the dependencies above, you can run
```
pip install selenium chromedriver html-testRunner webdriver-manager
```
