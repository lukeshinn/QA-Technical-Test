# Installation
The Python package installer is the recommended method for installing dependencies. If you don't have pip currently you can run the following command to install this package manager

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

after you have the pip package manager, if you are missing any of the dependencies above, you can run
pip install selenium chromedriver html-testRunner webdriver-manager
